00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,836
<i>Oh, no.
We're starting here? Okay.</i>

3
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,173
<i>From the very beginning
I've always made a statement.</i>

4
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,012
<i>Not everyone appreciated that.</i>

5
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,805
That's unfortunate.

6
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:55,724
<i>But I wasn't
for everyone.</i>

7
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:58,644
<i>Speaking of statements,
here's one.</i>

8
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,647
<i>That necklace
is the reason I'm dead.</i>

9
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,774
<i>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

10
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:05,817
<i>From an early age,
I realised I saw the world</i>

11
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:07,045
<i>differently than everyone else.</i>

12
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,111
Look!

13
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:09,339
Well, that's not the pattern.

14
00:01:09,363 --> 00:01:10,590
You have to follow the pattern.

15
00:01:10,614 --> 00:01:11,814
There's a way of doing things.

16
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:13,593
- That's ugly.
<i>- Including my mother.</i>

17
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:14,826
That's cruel.

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,828
Your name's Estella, not Cruella.

19
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,418
<i>It wasn't her I was challenging,</i>

20
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:24,878
<i>it was the world.</i>

21
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:29,716
<i>But, of course,
my mother knew that.</i>

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,968
<i>That's what worried her.</i>

23
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,345
Remember, you belong here
as much as anyone.

24
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:34,638
They're lucky to have you.

25
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:36,056
Agreed.

26
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:39,393
Hey, what do you say to Cruella
when she tries to get the better of you?

27
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:41,895
Thank you for coming
but you may go now.

28
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:43,522
Good. Now say goodbye to her.

29
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,023
Goodbye, Cruella.

30
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,525
And wear the hat.

31
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:48,610
I don't need the hat.

32
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:52,656
Well, be polite. And good.

33
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:54,658
And friendly.

34
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,619
<i>How does the saying go?</i>

35
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:00,163
<i>"I am woman. Hear me roar."</i>

36
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,582
<i>Well, that wasn't much
of a thing back in 1964,</i>

37
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:04,376
<i>but it was about to be.</i>

38
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:06,461
Hi, my name's Estella.

39
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:09,715
Look. A skunk's got loose
in the building.

40
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,217
Nice jacket.

41
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:14,386
Hi, I'm Anita.

42
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:15,762
Estella.

43
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:17,014
Ignore them.

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,474
Just did. But it might not last.

45
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:22,519
<i>"Ignore them"?</i>

46
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,522
<i>Didn't I just say,
"Hear me roar"?</i>

47
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,289
Fight! Fight! Fight!

48
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,950
<i>That didn't sit well
with some people.</i>

49
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:35,407
This is a blot on your copybook.

50
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,844
<i>Okay, that didn't
sit well with a lot of people.</i>

51
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:40,162
Enough.

52
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:41,872
She deserved it!

53
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,541
<i>But I found friends
in unlikely places.</i>

54
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,209
Hello.

55
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:48,837
<i>Like this guy.</i>

56
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,173
There's a dog?

57
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,383
Buddy. I found him.

58
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,178
<i>And not this guy.</i>

59
00:02:57,304 --> 00:03:00,682
<i>Her. Anita Darling.
What a fabulous name.</i>

60
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:11,151
<i>You could say
I pretty much roared my way</i>

61
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,320
<i>through all of primary school.</i>

62
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:16,782
<i>Almost.</i>

63
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:23,955
Well, I think it's clear
what happens now.

64
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:25,957
Estella, you are expelled...

65
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,085
I'm withdrawing her from your school.

66
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:29,503
I'm expelling her.

67
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:31,397
It's too late because
I withdrew her first,

68
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,881
so that can't be on her record.

69
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:35,467
I'd said expelled. I'd already said it.

70
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,177
Hadn't.

71
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,261
Didn't.

72
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,681
And, might I say, your school
seems to turn out horrible children

73
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:44,017
with no creativity or compassion.

74
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:45,394
Or genius.

75
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:49,523
You're out.

76
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,066
Out!

77
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,236
<i>Being a genius is one thing.</i>

78
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:57,781
<i>Raising a genius, however,
does come with its challenges.</i>

79
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:00,367
London, here we come!

80
00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:02,285
Well, we don't really have a choice.

81
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:06,581
You have no school.
It's nothing to celebrate.

82
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,671
Well...

83
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,341
Can't be a fashion designer
in a small town, anyway.

84
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:23,515
Can we go here?

85
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:28,520
Regent's Park? Perfect.

86
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:31,982
When we get to the city,
first thing we'll do,

87
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:34,526
we'll go to the fountain,
and we'll have a cup of tea

88
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,969
and we'll start planning
how to make this London thing work.

89
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,700
Why are you in your best dress?

90
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,628
I need to make a stop
on our way to the city.

91
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:46,942
Just ask a friend for a little help
to get us on our feet.

92
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,081
What friend?

93
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:51,626
Well, a friend because
of the situation that we're in.

94
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,508
I'll be less trouble from now on, mum.

95
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,886
I promise.

96
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:20,655
<i>I meant it
when I said it.</i>

97
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,828
<i>When a girl like me
makes a promise like that,</i>

98
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:29,664
<i>you don't take her to
a place like this.</i>

99
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,435
What is this place?

100
00:05:57,984 --> 00:05:59,653
Wear it. It looks good.

101
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:04,199
Looks better without, I think.
Be yours one day.

102
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:05,450
It's a family heirloom.

103
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:08,662
- Will you mind it for me?
- Really?

104
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:13,500
Come on, Buddy.

105
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,584
Er, Estella.

106
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,127
Serious voice.

107
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:18,421
Stay in the car. I won't be long.

108
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:20,131
Mum!

109
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,841
I need you to lie low.

110
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:23,677
Lie low while wearing a hat?

111
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:27,055
Exactly. Love you.

112
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:28,223
Love you more.

113
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:42,404
Don't worry, she'll be back soon.

114
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:44,197
<i>I did try to lay low.</i>

115
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:49,202
Is that fur and chiffon?
In the one gown?

116
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:52,664
<i>But, as you can see,
I broke the promise.</i>

117
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,208
<i>Just a little.</i>

118
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,295
I am. I'm sure
it'll be quite extravagant.

119
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,795
It usually is, isn't it?

120
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:01,131
Go to the east garden.
I'll see what I can do.

121
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:02,738
<i>I figured
while mum was busy</i>

122
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,676
<i>seeing her mysterious friend,</i>

123
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:06,678
<i>I'd just take a little peek.</i>

124
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:21,985
<i>The problem was,</i>

125
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:25,280
<i>that little peek
pretty much blew my mind.</i>

126
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:29,367
<i>I had no idea where I was
or what it was.</i>

127
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:33,121
<i>I just knew that,
for the first time in my life,</i>

128
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:35,206
<i>I felt like I belonged.</i>

129
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:41,379
<i>Buddy, unfortunately, did not.</i>

130
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:43,006
Buddy! No!

131
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,307
Got ya.

132
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:58,730
Keep the hat on,
before anyone sees that.

133
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,287
<i>I could've blamed Buddy
for what happened next.</i>

134
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:19,376
I just need a little help,
just to get us on our feet.

135
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,921
<i>But the truth is,
I did escalate things.</i>

136
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,331
Oh, my goodness!

137
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:55,412
Oh, crumbs!

138
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:58,081
And I will keep my mouth shut,

139
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:59,874
and I will never come back here.

140
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,170
- Mum!
- She's my life.

141
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:30,029
No!

142
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:38,246
<i>There are no words.</i>

143
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:40,373
There's been
the most dreadful accident.

144
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:41,499
<i>It was my fault.</i>

145
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,146
Police Commissioner Weston!

146
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:44,711
A woman...

147
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,921
She was threatening me,
demanding money. I...

148
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:49,257
<i>I had killed my mother.</i>

149
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:51,217
I think they were chasing someone.

150
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:52,427
Search the grounds!

151
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:53,738
<i>And in that moment...</i>

152
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:55,096
Search the grounds!

153
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,849
<i>...the best
I could think to do</i>

154
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:01,144
<i>was run.</i>

155
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:27,879
<i>And I ran for a long time.</i>

156
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:11,297
<i>I made it to London after all.</i>

157
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:14,884
<i>Regent's Park.</i>

158
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:17,053
<i>But no tea.</i>

159
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,860
It's all my fault, Buddy.

160
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,139
<i>No mum.</i>

161
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:24,143
I never should've gone in.

162
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,230
<i>I was an orphan.</i>

163
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:35,029
My necklace.

164
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,034
<i>Sad story.</i>

165
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:45,582
<i>Genius girl turns into stupid girl
who gets her mother killed</i>

166
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,668
<i>and ends up alone.</i>

167
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:56,092
<i>But a new day brings
new opportunities</i>

168
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:59,178
<i>or at least a couple of
petty thieves. Horace...</i>

169
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:01,306
Sir, please could you
spare some change?

170
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,390
No, sorry.

171
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:03,850
<i>...and Jasper.</i>

172
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:10,565
Morning.

173
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:14,736
Stay back!

174
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:16,571
<i>Horace was generally annoying.</i>

175
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:18,531
Ow!

176
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:21,117
Go back to your family, little girl!

177
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:23,453
<i>Jasper was the insightful one.</i>

178
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,704
She has no family.

179
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:26,151
<i>Which was also annoying.</i>

180
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:28,207
<i>And Wink was just plain friendly.</i>

181
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,751
<i>Again, annoying.</i>

182
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:31,961
Buddy!

183
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,173
- Oi!
- Come on, Horace.

184
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,342
<i>But they were a better option
than being in jail.</i>

185
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:38,468
Stop!

186
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:39,844
Police!

187
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,100
Oi, you little scallywags!

188
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:40,905
That was close.

189
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:42,657
I think we lost her.

190
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,283
You think?

191
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:51,582
Where are we?

192
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,793
So, what's your story?

193
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:56,796
Where are your parents?

194
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,931
My mum's dead.

195
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,268
<i>I skipped over the part
where I killed her.</i>

196
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:15,231
I think you should stay here,
be a part of our gang.

197
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,817
She should what?
What, what, what?

198
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,110
This has not been discussed.

199
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:21,487
It's being discussed now.
And we could use a girl

200
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:24,532
to look innocent and be a distraction.

201
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:32,123
I wanted to be a fashion designer,

202
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,624
not a thief.

203
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,377
You don't got that many options.
Just us.

204
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,796
<i>He was right.
I was a fugitive.</i>

205
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:40,757
Is she crying again?

206
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:44,761
Her mum died.
You remember what that's like.

207
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:49,015
<i>And there was one thing
I knew they'd be looking for.</i>

208
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:51,017
Cripes!

209
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:55,021
I need to dye my hair.

210
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,524
I don't know, I quite like it.

211
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:06,199
<i>Granted, being a thief
is not exactly a mother's dream,</i>

212
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:09,577
<i>but she was gone.</i>

213
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:18,044
<i>Don't worry,
we're just getting started.</i>

214
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,605
<i>There's lots more bad things coming...</i>

215
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:20,713
<i>I promise.</i>

216
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:38,856
Let's go, Buddy.

217
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:44,195
We're on!

218
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:47,073
<i>Before I knew it,
ten years had passed.</i>

219
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,700
<i>You could even say
we had made a home for ourselves.</i>

220
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:51,244
Horace! Heads-up!

221
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:54,080
Two minutes! It's stoppage time.

222
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:55,447
<i>We were like a family.</i>

223
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:57,416
Horace, let's go!

224
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,877
<i>- A family that's good at...</i>
- Get dressed!

225
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:01,420
<i>...stealing stuff.</i>

226
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:03,131
I'm frightfully sorry.

227
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:04,814
Do you know if Piccadilly is the next...

228
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:06,134
<i>Really,</i>

229
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:08,719
<i>really,</i>

230
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:11,264
<i>really good.</i>

231
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:13,641
Oh, this is me.

232
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:35,079
<i>We expanded our business.</i>

233
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,801
<i>I designed fabulous disguises.</i>

234
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:51,179
<i>We'd steal.</i>

235
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:54,307
There you go, madam.

236
00:16:58,144 --> 00:16:59,812
<i>I'd design.</i>

237
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:06,777
<i>We'd steal.</i>

238
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:09,113
Not your dog!
We are not coming back here!

239
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:12,617
<i>Design.</i>

240
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:19,957
<i>It was a beautiful operation.</i>

241
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,254
<i>I got to do what I love,</i>

242
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,382
<i>and we were reaping the rewards.</i>

243
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:34,263
<i>But, as good as things were, I felt
I was meant for more in this life.</i>

244
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,557
<i>That my mum would've wanted
more for me.</i>

245
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:38,476
<i>I just didn't know what.</i>

246
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,064
Hey! Psst!

247
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:44,886
What are you doing?

248
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:53,491
Just bored.

249
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:55,534
Bored? Are you kidding?

250
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,411
I found a tiny TV.

251
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,122
Japanese fellow asleep on the bed.

252
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,503
Er, excuse me, who are you three?

253
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,671
Run.

254
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:10,258
Good Lord!

255
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:11,676
Oi! Thieves!

256
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,152
Two, three!

257
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:32,236
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

258
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,366
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

259
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,995
<i>Happy birthday,
dear Estell-la-la-la-la!</i>

260
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,122
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

261
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:42,707
<i>And me and Jasper</i>

262
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,667
<i>And Wink and Buddy</i>

263
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,753
This is the nicest birthday in...

264
00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:50,631
In a while.

265
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:52,133
Not for Judy.

266
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,676
- Who's Judy?
- It doesn't matter.

267
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:55,511
It is not a big deal.
She just...

268
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:56,721
Oh, Judy.

269
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:57,847
...might be hungry.

270
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:04,812
- Make a wish.
- Thanks, guys. Thanks, Judy.

271
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:09,275
What's this?

272
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:12,194
This is an offer of employment
from Liberty of London.

273
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,738
Entry-level position.

274
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,032
Oh, I hope it's a burger place, right?

275
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:20,453
No, it's the most fashionable
department store in the city.

276
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,246
How did you do this?

277
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,373
Pulled a couple of strings.

278
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:29,879
I love Liberty!

279
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:33,090
Yeah, I know you do.
I see you look at it every time we pass.

280
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:34,937
Now, I might have padded out
your CV a bit.

281
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,111
As in, completely. Invented it.

282
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:37,136
We've all done it.

283
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,363
Yeah, we've all done it.
Everyone does it.

284
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,722
Invented a few references.

285
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:42,266
If they ask you
how you know Prince Charles,

286
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,894
you just say it's a polo thing.

287
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:46,145
Right.

288
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,396
Happy birthday.

289
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:48,564
"Polo thing."

290
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:52,693
So, what is the angle?

291
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,821
There is no angle,
other than Estella living her dream.

292
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,740
- Right. Okay.
- Yeah.

293
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,301
What is it really?
What's the angle?

294
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:01,285
No, there is...
All right, I'll tell you what,

295
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:05,581
the angle is that
Estella is way too talented

296
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:07,628
to be doing grifts
with the likes of me and you.

297
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,418
Thanks, Jasper.

298
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:10,586
It's all right.

299
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:18,677
Mum, I got my chance.
The one I always wanted.

300
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,765
Trust me, I'm going to keep
my head down and make it.

301
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,434
Cheers.

302
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:35,903
<i>Liberty of London.</i>

303
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:42,326
<i>It was the pinnacle of fashion
in the '70s.</i>

304
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,246
<i>They carried all the best designers.</i>

305
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,417
<i>And now I worked there.</i>

306
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:06,934
Now, you mentioned the scarf as well.

307
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:35,463
On Tuesday?

308
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,598
I have it right in front of me here.

309
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:47,975
I told him to be very specific
about what I wrote.

310
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,273
Ah, excuse me, sir.

311
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,150
I had a thought
about the front window...

312
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,444
I gave you your job description.

313
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:02,031
Don't go outside the boundaries
of your engagement. Please.

314
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,786
Not now.

315
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:11,332
- Ah! Sir...
- Not now.

316
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:14,627
No, no, no.

317
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,019
Not now.

318
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:43,572
Ah!

319
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:50,621
Sir, I just wanted to say,
I really am a dab hand with a needle

320
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:52,148
if Alterations could use anything.

321
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,875
Why are you talking and not cleaning?

322
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:57,920
Did you do all the bathrooms
according to the regulations I gave you?

323
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,714
- Soap, water, mop, bleach, polish?
- I did.

324
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:01,924
- In that order?
- Yes.

325
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,551
But Alterations, you wouldn't...

326
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,096
regret it.

327
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,310
- Hey.
- Hey!

328
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:14,728
Hi.

329
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,730
You forgot your lunch.

330
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,441
Thank you.

331
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:25,406
No.

332
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,490
What?

333
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:29,577
I'm not letting you in that window,
so you can try and crack the safe.

334
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:31,832
- That's not the angle?
- No. There is no angle.

335
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,956
There's no angle.

336
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:37,001
What do you mean, there's no angle?
Come on, Wink!

337
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,171
There's no angle.

338
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,298
Horace.

339
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,675
Thanks for lunch. Bye, Wink.

340
00:23:55,436 --> 00:23:56,729
Really?

341
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:04,862
Perfect.

342
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,504
I feel sad
that you think that looks good.

343
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:23,589
What?

344
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:26,050
I feel sad you think
that looks good.

345
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:35,934
Afternoon.

346
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,645
Lovely hat.

347
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,480
Whatever covers your neck more.

348
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:52,117
You have...

349
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:57,706
a circular slice of banana
on your cheek.

350
00:24:58,248 --> 00:24:59,249
Other side.

351
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:06,423
- My office. Now! Now, now.
- Okay.

352
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,807
Before you fire me,
I have something to say.

353
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:21,271
Clean my office, top to bottom.

354
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:26,068
And, er, when you come in tomorrow,
try and remember to bring a brain.

355
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:28,278
That seems uncalled for.

356
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:31,740
I believe that lurking underneath

357
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:35,911
that starchy, half-size-too-small,
bum-clencher of a suit

358
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:40,666
lies a kind man who wants
to give a brilliant kid another shot.

359
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,465
Clean, now!

360
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,213
I just can't leave you
looking like that.

361
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:11,799
It would be cruel.

362
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:30,025
Why'd you go to sleep in a window?

363
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,443
Who's... What...

364
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,493
Oh...

365
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:42,871
Oh, but seriously,
how much better do you look?

366
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:44,998
No! No!

367
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,168
Hello.

368
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,462
Out! Out!

369
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,756
Oh, farts.

370
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,719
Come with me. Leave the bag.

371
00:27:58,345 --> 00:27:59,447
Thousand apologies.

372
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:00,597
Horace, no!

373
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,641
I'm calling the police, vandal.

374
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:05,185
She's coming!
The Baroness. She's out front.

375
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,104
- What?
- The Baroness!

376
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:08,188
She's coming!

377
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,314
No!

378
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:15,737
Hello. Is there a, er, back way out,
or...

379
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,114
The Baroness.

380
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:18,866
The fashion designer!
I want to see her.

381
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,587
Find the girl.

382
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:42,306
That's her.

383
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:48,663
Estella, they're distracted.

384
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:49,730
Let's go!

385
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:51,815
Baroness.

386
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,740
Outside. That window display.

387
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,784
I'm so sorry.

388
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,745
I can explain that.

389
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:06,246
You're right, time to go.

390
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,665
Sorry, Baroness...

391
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,751
Get her.

392
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:14,546
She's the vandal who messed up
the whole new window display.

393
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:15,714
Hello.

394
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:16,882
We're dealing with it.

395
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:18,926
All right, easy, easy, easy!

396
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:20,469
So she works here?

397
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,888
Oh, no, no. She was fired. Yeah.

398
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:27,601
We try to give these wretches a chance,
but, um, breeding.

399
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,478
Need I say more?

400
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,813
So she doesn't work here?

401
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,234
Sorry.
I'm not convinced I know...

402
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,820
You're sweating, and I can smell you.

403
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,155
Brilliant. Thank you.

404
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,368
You. Grubby girl.

405
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,452
Yes?

406
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:46,662
Jeffrey, card.

407
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:47,746
Card?

408
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:55,128
You're hired. This address.
5:00 a.m. Don't be late.

409
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,923
Teeth. Teeth.

410
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:03,011
You're a fool.

411
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:05,555
That girl put together
a better window display

412
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:06,974
than I've seen here for 10 years.

413
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:08,517
Hear, hear!

414
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:10,477
You were right,
this is a very good shop.

415
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:14,523
God, it's all so depressing.

416
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,054
She liked my window, Jasper.
She liked my window!

417
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:47,264
I'm happy for you.

418
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:49,141
It's all thanks to you.

419
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:50,308
No.

420
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,269
So...

421
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:54,563
this was the angle, then?

422
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:00,318
<i>It's funny
how those happy accidents</i>

423
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:02,487
<i>can change the whole direction
of your life.</i>

424
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:06,199
<i>Although, looking back,
"happy" may be the wrong word.</i>

425
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:13,999
Ah, you.

426
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:16,960
Quickly, come on!

427
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,295
Right, okay.

428
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:23,133
Come along. Up here.

429
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:00,462
Silence!

430
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:26,029
My last show was a triumph.

431
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:30,117
Shall I read to you
from <i>Tattletale?</i>

432
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:35,664
"Baroness designs stunned
with her reinvention of the A-line

433
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,375
"with a bias cut and higher line...

434
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:45,590
"...that reshapes the silhouette
in such an audacious way

435
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,760
"the audience broke into
rapturous applause at first sight.

436
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:51,304
"She really is a genius."

437
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,600
I'll read that bit again, shall I?

438
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,563
"She really is a genius."

439
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,023
A triumph.

440
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:04,734
Take a moment to revel in it.

441
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:15,704
Oh, that's enough. New show.
We must be perfect. Now go.

442
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,208
Window girl.

443
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,520
Grab a mannequin, some fabric,
and throw something together.

444
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,045
The Baroness needs looks.

445
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:26,464
Looks. Right.

446
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:49,654
It's foolish.

447
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:51,865
Unhinged.

448
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,410
Well, you're fired.

449
00:33:57,245 --> 00:34:00,081
Pasty, pasty, pasty.

450
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:04,211
Hmm.

451
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:08,215
Why are you speaking?

452
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:10,091
I think you nicked me.

453
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,011
Just...

454
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,806
Fabrics!
Can you get me a red like that?

455
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:50,840
Oh.

456
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,426
Welcome to Second Time Around,

457
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,137
I'm Artie or Art, as in "work of."

458
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,014
Wow! You look incredible.

459
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:00,517
I hear that all day,
so I guess it's true.

460
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,831
How does that look go on the streets?

461
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,729
Mmm, some abuse and insults, of course.

462
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:06,231
But I like to say that
"normal" is

463
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:09,484
the cruellest insult of them all
and at least I never get that.

464
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,695
I couldn't agree more.

465
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,071
Look around, Cinderella.

466
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:15,323
I have everything a girl
or boy could ever want.

467
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,159
If you can dream it, I can dress it.

468
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,371
Dior, 1955, amazing.

469
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,085
Chanel, 1950. Spring collection.

470
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:29,754
Ah, you know your gowns.

471
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:33,008
You and I are going to be
very good friends, Artie.

472
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:37,137
Baroness, '65, in the window.
Winter collection.

473
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,930
I noticed that.

474
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,151
Grubby girl, get me lunch.

475
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:53,320
Soy salmon, lemon-zest risotto,

476
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:56,448
cucumber sliced into two-inch diagonals
at an eighth of an inch width

477
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:59,993
sprinkled with seven leaves of parsley,
shredded, not torn.

478
00:36:01,536 --> 00:36:02,537
Right.

479
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,209
As the department stores
that stock your range,

480
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:12,047
we thought perhaps
we could give you some input.

481
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,173
Feedback.

482
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:15,675
Oh, great. I'll start, shall I?

483
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:17,427
My feedback.

484
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:24,225
You're short, you're fat,
you smell like an anchovy,

485
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:27,103
you're colour-blind
but you pretend you aren't.

486
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,523
You're a man
who can't take responsibility.

487
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,985
Your revenues are down 15%,
your foot traffic by 12 and a half.

488
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,779
Yes, I do my own research.

489
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:38,156
Your store hasn't been refurbished
since the Blitz.

490
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,825
People don't know whether to buy a frock
or duck and cover.

491
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:44,245
And most of the funds meant for refurbs
are being embezzled by you,

492
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:48,208
stashing them in Swiss bank
account number 32254766

493
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,043
to be precise.

494
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:53,671
That's me. Your turn.

495
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:55,965
I'm all ears.

496
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:02,931
Good day.

497
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,267
Imbeciles.

498
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,314
Lunch. Now.

499
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:19,322
Oh. Finally, someone competent.

500
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:21,157
Whoa!

501
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,701
And someone not.
This is my lawyer, Roger.

502
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:27,223
Although he spends most of his time
playing piano in a dingy little bar,

503
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,082
actually, he's a good lawyer.

504
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:30,917
Hi.

505
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,043
Hi.

506
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,129
Piano's nice.

507
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:35,338
Yes.

508
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:37,132
Time for my nine-minute power nap.

509
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:38,383
Box up my lunch, Estella.

510
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,437
It could do with a lining.

511
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:55,150
You could use tulle to puff it out,
give it some body.

512
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,447
That's what I just said.

513
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,791
Baroness.

514
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:16,421
Keep up, Estella.

515
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,723
Jewels.

516
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,060
And, Estella, make the bodice

517
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:33,855
pencil thin.

518
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:47,744
Estella, did you make it pencil thin?

519
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:59,672
All right, how do I look?

520
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,925
- Fabulous.
- Well, I know that.

521
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,051
Show me.

522
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:07,305
Mmm.

523
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:09,349
How would you have done it?

524
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,237
Hmm.

525
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,031
I think you're...

526
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,910
something.

527
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:31,287
Come along.

528
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:42,340
I made this.

529
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:46,594
The Baroness said
she thinks I'm something.

530
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:48,638
I think that's good.

531
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:54,727
Everything's going so well, mum.

532
00:39:57,105 --> 00:40:00,024
I'm really trying to be
the Estella that you wanted.

533
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,528
Mostly. It's working.

534
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:07,323
I just wish you were here to see it.

535
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,663
There's something
about it that irritates me

536
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,416
and I always trust my instincts.

537
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:21,421
I thought maybe
if you tighten the silhouette...

538
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,673
Oh, you thought, did you?

539
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,550
I think it's better.

540
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:28,011
Actually, it is.

541
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,938
Your necklace.

542
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:41,107
Oh.

543
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:42,942
Family heirloom. Funny story, actually.

544
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,235
An employee once stole it.

545
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,320
No, she did not.

546
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,908
Sorry.

547
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:54,370
Slight tone delivery problem. I meant...

548
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:59,125
"No. She did not."
Did she work for you?

549
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,586
Mmm. Once. Years before.

550
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:03,880
She stole this,

551
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:06,549
was stupid enough to come back

552
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,551
and then she fell off a cliff and died.

553
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,428
How terrible.

554
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:12,615
Yes, it was, actually.
It was during my winter ball

555
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,308
and her death really overshadowed
the whole thing.

556
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:18,019
Time for my nine-minute power nap.

557
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:20,438
Who was the woman?

558
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:25,318
Not really the point of the story.

559
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:28,071
The story's about how lucky I am,
but anyway, she had a kid.

560
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:31,908
Kid's a snowflake.
Special, blah-blah-blah.

561
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,869
It was a basic shakedown
situation actually.

562
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:40,833
Maybe she...

563
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:43,002
Maybe she just really loved her kid.

564
00:41:43,169 --> 00:41:46,172
Maybe she only had one person
to take care of

565
00:41:46,255 --> 00:41:47,965
and she failed dismally.

566
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:08,486
Speak.

567
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:10,947
Baroness, we have that meeting
at the Ritz.

568
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,448
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

569
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:20,039
Necklace.
Roger, shoes.

570
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,626
Don't touch the ankle.

571
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:24,919
Yes, sorry. It's in.

572
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:26,087
Come along.

573
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:40,309
<i>My mother hadn't
failed dismally. I had.</i>

574
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:43,521
<i>And I wasn't going to
fail her again.</i>

575
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,817
Told you, she always comes here.

576
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:51,738
Oi.

577
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,199
You all right?

578
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:58,411
She called my mum a thief.

579
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:00,788
Said she failed as a mother.

580
00:43:01,831 --> 00:43:04,542
What? Your mum?
She knew your actual mum?

581
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:07,587
Yeah, it turns out
that was her party we were at.

582
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:09,964
Mum worked for her once.

583
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:13,309
I dropped the necklace
as I was running away.

584
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:14,677
She must've found it.

585
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:19,724
It's mine. So I'm taking it back.

586
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:21,392
- Taking it, as in...
- Stealing it.

587
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:22,518
Yeah.

588
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:26,939
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you... the angle.

589
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:37,116
Her Black and White Ball,
that's where we'll do it.

590
00:43:37,283 --> 00:43:41,120
It's our biggest job ever.
Oi, Horace, attention.

591
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,873
<i>We need to know
their security setup.</i>

592
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:47,543
Power nap, nine minutes.

593
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:53,007
<i>Where the cameras are.</i>

594
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:56,344
<i>Where the guards are posted.</i>

595
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:00,807
<i>And what the schedules are.</i>

596
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:05,686
<i>We need to know every detail
and every blind spot.</i>

597
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:37,677
Okay,
the toilet's just on the left,

598
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,821
and then go straight down to the end.

599
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:40,179
Thanks.

600
00:44:52,942 --> 00:44:56,737
<i>Then, all we need to do
is disable the security system,</i>

601
00:44:56,821 --> 00:45:00,575
<i>bypass the cameras,
open the safe, steal the necklace</i>

602
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:04,078
during the biggest party of the season.

603
00:45:04,412 --> 00:45:07,039
So many people, her security
will be stretched to the limit

604
00:45:07,248 --> 00:45:10,251
and, just to be sure,
a distraction,

605
00:45:10,459 --> 00:45:12,420
where I get the key
to the keypad and safe.

606
00:45:12,587 --> 00:45:14,297
Right, so what is the distraction?

607
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:18,217
I've discovered she likes to throw women
who offend her sensibilities

608
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:19,927
out of her parties.

609
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:22,972
- Old women. Women in gold.
- Ow!

610
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:24,849
<i>Sad women.</i>

611
00:45:25,016 --> 00:45:26,517
<i>Women who carry poodles.</i>

612
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:30,021
But also stunningly dressed women
who pull the focus off of her.

613
00:45:30,855 --> 00:45:32,398
What about one of the elderly broads?

614
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:35,192
Me, Horace. I will be the distraction.

615
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,736
All right.

616
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:40,781
Besides, wreaking havoc at galas
is my personal speciality.

617
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:44,368
Well, I don't know about that.
But here's a problem...

618
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:45,786
Won't she recognise you?

619
00:45:45,953 --> 00:45:47,121
That's a good point.

620
00:45:47,288 --> 00:45:48,432
- I guess.
- And when that happens,

621
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:49,498
won't you lose your job?

622
00:45:49,665 --> 00:45:50,708
It's not on the board.

623
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,551
- A job I think you love.
- Are you thinking?

624
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:53,979
I mean, she sees you're talented, right?

625
00:45:54,003 --> 00:45:55,087
Yes. Yes.

626
00:45:55,463 --> 00:45:58,966
Well, maybe...
Maybe you don't need the necklace.

627
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:00,384
Maybe...

628
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:02,345
Mate, come on! This is the angle.

629
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:04,388
- It's just a necklace.
- I want it back!

630
00:46:07,558 --> 00:46:08,851
She's the boss.

631
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:12,897
And you're right.

632
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:17,068
You're right. She will recognise me.

633
00:46:18,611 --> 00:46:20,279
So Estella can't go to the ball,

634
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:25,534
but I know someone who can.

635
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,590
Right, let's do it.

636
00:46:39,757 --> 00:46:41,968
Yeah. Let's go and ruin someone's day.

637
00:46:42,134 --> 00:46:44,387
You mean the Baroness?

638
00:46:45,513 --> 00:46:47,807
Obviously, I mean the Baroness.

639
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:48,891
Right.

640
00:46:48,975 --> 00:46:50,055
Why? Who did you think I...

641
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:51,102
No, you said "someone."

642
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:53,604
- Someone could be anyone...
- Let's just do this, Horace.

643
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:12,248
Not tonight, son.

644
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,710
Well, you know what?
They said it was an emergency.

645
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:17,420
This is a private event.

646
00:47:20,798 --> 00:47:24,760
Kind of vermin I deal with,
they don't wait for an invitation.

647
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:28,097
What they do is they get in,
they bite posh people

648
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:29,908
who then froth at the mouth,
their eyes spin

649
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:32,768
in the back of their heads
and then the posh people die.

650
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:39,346
That's a beautiful story, mate.
I almost welled up, yeah?

651
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:42,528
Freeze. Freeze.

652
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:46,032
Whatever you do, don't turn around.

653
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:53,289
Well, don't just stand there!
Get in and get him out!

654
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:56,208
I told you not to turn around.
And wash your hands.

655
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:58,127
Heck of a rat, yeah?

656
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,755
The size of a dog. But it's a rat.

657
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,665
Miss Anita Darling.

658
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:38,167
Baroness.

659
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:41,087
I'm so grateful you've given <i>Tattletale</i>
an exclusive tonight.

660
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:45,716
Not apparently grateful enough
to observe the dress code.

661
00:48:48,552 --> 00:48:50,721
No colour.

662
00:48:50,888 --> 00:48:53,933
Well, my pen must have leaked.
Tools of my trade.

663
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,144
No one is interested
in what you write, my dear.

664
00:48:57,311 --> 00:48:59,522
Just in how I look.

665
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:07,905
You look ravishing, Baroness.

666
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:10,950
Master of understatement, as usual.

667
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:20,334
Here's...

668
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,002
to me.

669
00:49:23,087 --> 00:49:24,630
To the Baroness!

670
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,353
Do you have a light?

671
00:49:57,955 --> 00:49:59,290
Get her.

672
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,378
Come on, Wink.

673
00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:10,801
I'm a wee bit nervous.

674
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:13,488
This doesn't have to be a scene.

675
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:16,056
It really, really does.

676
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:22,730
My arm. I think it's broken.

677
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,607
Is there a doctor?

678
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:28,777
Oh, no, actually it's fine.

679
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:31,530
I'd like to remind you all
that I'm doing this in heels.

680
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,502
Ratbane! Abort! They can see you
on the cameras. Abort.

681
00:50:45,586 --> 00:50:46,587
What?

682
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:56,222
There are six of you,
so obviously you'll win,

683
00:50:56,388 --> 00:51:00,476
but the first two of you to arrive
are going to get very badly hurt.

684
00:51:00,643 --> 00:51:02,770
Initiate plan B.

685
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:06,315
No, no, no!

686
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:09,944
Oh! Oh! Look at that one!

687
00:51:17,576 --> 00:51:20,120
No. Get out! My wires!

688
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:23,457
So, discuss amongst yourselves
who that is, hmm?

689
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,584
There we are.

690
00:51:25,668 --> 00:51:27,503
No, no, no.

691
00:51:27,628 --> 00:51:29,255
You hideous freak.

692
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:30,778
I didn't mean that, Wink.

693
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:37,181
<i>All right, we're good.</i>

694
00:51:38,764 --> 00:51:40,432
Oh! I'm so sorry.

695
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,519
Hang on!
We haven't started yet, darling.

696
00:51:45,312 --> 00:51:47,064
Is that two? I lost count.

697
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:53,904
Oh, for heaven's sake,
just bring her to me.

698
00:51:55,364 --> 00:51:57,074
Oi. Shh.

699
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:58,237
You're supposed to be dead!

700
00:51:58,325 --> 00:51:59,952
That's a bit much.

701
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:11,380
Nothing to see here.

702
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:18,929
Horace, how's it going?

703
00:52:19,096 --> 00:52:20,306
How's it going? Well, I...

704
00:52:23,392 --> 00:52:24,518
Well, I'd say badly.

705
00:52:27,479 --> 00:52:29,023
Oh, no.

706
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:33,110
Who are you?
You look vaguely familiar.

707
00:52:34,862 --> 00:52:36,363
I look stunning.

708
00:52:36,447 --> 00:52:38,073
I don't know about familiar, darling.

709
00:52:38,407 --> 00:52:40,159
Your hair, is it real?

710
00:52:40,326 --> 00:52:43,662
Black and White Ball.
I like to make an impact.

711
00:52:46,915 --> 00:52:48,959
Right. What was your name?

712
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:52,504
Cruella.

713
00:52:53,047 --> 00:52:54,214
- Oh.
- Mmm.

714
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,926
That's quite fabulous.
And you designed this?

715
00:52:58,093 --> 00:53:01,722
You did, actually. 1965 collection.

716
00:53:01,889 --> 00:53:03,557
Oh, no wonder I love it, it's mine.

717
00:53:03,724 --> 00:53:04,725
I fixed it.

718
00:53:06,477 --> 00:53:09,396
Oh, sit. Do, I insist.

719
00:53:09,563 --> 00:53:13,776
I'm intrigued, and that never happens.

720
00:53:28,457 --> 00:53:30,376
Yes. Aren't they gorgeous?

721
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:33,045
And vicious.

722
00:53:33,629 --> 00:53:35,464
It's my favourite combination.

723
00:53:45,516 --> 00:53:46,975
What do you want?

724
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:49,478
I mean, you clearly wanted
to get my attention.

725
00:53:52,815 --> 00:53:54,400
I want to be like you.

726
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:57,778
You're a very powerful woman.

727
00:54:08,831 --> 00:54:10,374
Let me give you some advice.

728
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:14,211
If you need to talk about power,
you don't have it.

729
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:16,314
Well, I don't have it, which is why

730
00:54:16,338 --> 00:54:18,024
I need to talk about it,
which is why I'm here.

731
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:20,448
Am I going to have to catch you up
a lot, or can you keep up?

732
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:24,430
You're funny.

733
00:54:24,596 --> 00:54:28,016
It's not just rats.
There's mice, lizards...

734
00:54:30,394 --> 00:54:34,064
Raccoons. There's a whole mess
of different kinds of...

735
00:54:36,567 --> 00:54:38,360
Oh, that's a hybrid.

736
00:54:43,407 --> 00:54:44,491
Where are you from?

737
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:47,244
Oh. Well, um...

738
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:49,997
Up...

739
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:53,542
north. Well, sort of.

740
00:54:56,128 --> 00:55:00,007
It's a bit south, really, of north,
which is basically west.

741
00:55:00,174 --> 00:55:02,468
All right, that's enough.
I've loved our little chat,

742
00:55:02,634 --> 00:55:06,722
but I'm afraid that now I'm going
to have to have you arrested, um, for

743
00:55:07,431 --> 00:55:08,515
trespassing.

744
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:13,103
Oh. Is that a rat?

745
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:23,113
Oh, my God! Get it off!
Get it off! Get off!

746
00:55:24,656 --> 00:55:25,824
Someone's stolen my necklace.

747
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:27,618
Later, boys.

748
00:55:37,169 --> 00:55:38,545
Now it's a party!

749
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,967
That dog. Stop! Thief!

750
00:56:27,928 --> 00:56:30,055
You're the bravest rat I've ever known.

751
00:56:36,812 --> 00:56:38,397
Oh, we need that!

752
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,410
Well, here's hoping there's a plan C.

753
00:56:51,577 --> 00:56:52,661
Why, what's plan C?

754
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:54,548
No, what I'm saying is,
"Is there a plan C?"

755
00:56:54,705 --> 00:56:55,998
Yeah, but...

756
00:56:57,541 --> 00:56:58,542
Get in!

757
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,835
Yeah.

758
00:57:00,252 --> 00:57:02,212
A bit quicker! You're a dog!

759
00:57:08,218 --> 00:57:09,219
Whoa.

760
00:57:09,928 --> 00:57:11,288
Didn't know you knew how to drive.

761
00:57:14,975 --> 00:57:16,476
- Whoa...
- I don't.

762
00:57:17,019 --> 00:57:18,103
There's a car!

763
00:57:29,156 --> 00:57:31,450
All right. Stop the car!

764
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,207
What's going on?

765
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:42,836
Hey, hey! What are you doing?
Where's she going?

766
00:57:54,514 --> 00:57:56,058
The Baroness killed my mother.

767
00:57:56,558 --> 00:57:57,893
What? What are you talking about?

768
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,812
Her whistle, she called the dogs on her,
she was...

769
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:03,815
It wasn't my fault.

770
00:58:05,275 --> 00:58:06,943
She killed her.

771
00:58:07,486 --> 00:58:09,154
Like she was nothing.

772
00:58:09,863 --> 00:58:11,698
Oh, blimey.

773
00:58:23,585 --> 00:58:26,421
<i>They say there are
five stages of grief.</i>

774
00:58:27,923 --> 00:58:32,511
<i>Denial, anger, bargaining,
depression and acceptance.</i>

775
00:58:35,597 --> 00:58:37,724
<i>Well, I'd like to add one more.</i>

776
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:41,269
<i>Revenge.</i>

777
00:58:42,771 --> 00:58:44,231
We should lay low.

778
00:58:45,023 --> 00:58:46,149
Yeah.

779
00:58:46,316 --> 00:58:47,943
That was a bit much last night.

780
00:58:48,026 --> 00:58:51,363
You think? I fell into a cake.

781
00:58:59,996 --> 00:59:01,206
Morning, boys.

782
00:59:01,373 --> 00:59:02,666
Morning.

783
00:59:09,798 --> 00:59:11,550
So, let's begin.

784
00:59:13,218 --> 00:59:15,018
You're not gonna kill her, are ya?

785
00:59:15,262 --> 00:59:18,140
It's not part of the current plan,
but we might need to be adaptable.

786
00:59:18,306 --> 00:59:19,349
So, that's a no?

787
00:59:19,516 --> 00:59:23,228
If you heard a "no," it is.
Now, the necklace.

788
00:59:23,395 --> 00:59:24,938
One of the Dalmatians ate it.

789
00:59:25,105 --> 00:59:27,649
Not sure which one,
so you'll need to kidnap all of them.

790
00:59:27,816 --> 00:59:29,736
All right, sorry. Slow down.
What? What are we...

791
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:32,487
Darling, if I'm going to
need to repeat myself a lot,

792
00:59:32,654 --> 00:59:34,281
this isn't going to work out.

793
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:37,290
Why you still talking like that?
Grift's over.

794
00:59:38,368 --> 00:59:40,787
The necklace went in one end, yes?

795
00:59:40,954 --> 00:59:44,124
It's going to come out the other.
That's how it works.

796
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:48,754
And what about breakfast?
Which is now on the floor.

797
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,690
What's the rest of the plan?
Where are you going?

798
00:59:50,714 --> 00:59:52,174
Need-to-know basis.

799
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,967
But that's not how we usually...

800
00:59:55,594 --> 00:59:57,554
- ...work.
- That was rude.

801
00:59:58,054 --> 00:59:59,347
Yeah, but it's her mum, innit?

802
00:59:59,431 --> 01:00:01,183
We gotta cut her some slack.
Help her out.

803
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:02,976
Well,
it's not seeming like a lot of fun.

804
01:00:03,143 --> 01:00:04,787
- My Krispies are on the floor.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

805
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:06,563
Let's just get the dogs.

806
01:00:13,528 --> 01:00:16,782
Anita Darling, my darling.

807
01:00:22,454 --> 01:00:24,456
Estella, it's been so long.

808
01:00:26,374 --> 01:00:29,085
You know, I kept staring
at you at the party,

809
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:30,629
and then it came to me.

810
01:00:31,046 --> 01:00:32,923
That's Estella from school.

811
01:00:33,089 --> 01:00:34,508
It's not Estella.

812
01:00:35,342 --> 01:00:37,260
That's the past.

813
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:39,221
I'm Cruella.

814
01:00:42,098 --> 01:00:45,727
So, you go to parties
and you take pictures

815
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:49,064
and you print gossip?
That's your job?

816
01:00:49,564 --> 01:00:51,942
Yes, well. Not as fun as it sounds.

817
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:55,445
Oh, it doesn't sound fun.
It sounds useful.

818
01:00:56,446 --> 01:00:57,447
Oh.

819
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:02,702
I'd like to start my own label.

820
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:07,123
Why don't we work together
to create some buzz

821
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:09,334
for this old rag

822
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:11,753
that you continually fill
with that old hag?

823
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:15,841
You have that glint in your eye.

824
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:17,801
What glint?

825
01:01:18,802 --> 01:01:21,638
Well, I'm starting to remember that

826
01:01:21,805 --> 01:01:23,473
you have a bit of an extreme side.

827
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:30,313
Well, then you remember
what fun that is.

828
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:37,195
Now, I want you to help me
tell them who I am.

829
01:01:49,249 --> 01:01:52,711
You notice how some dog owners
look a lot like their dogs?

830
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:55,797
No. I've never noticed that.

831
01:01:57,549 --> 01:01:58,550
What about now?

832
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:00,862
All right, let's have a bit of
professionalism, please, Horace.

833
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:01,988
We got a job to do, all right?

834
01:02:02,012 --> 01:02:04,723
Wink is a very likable dog.
I'm not sure this plan will work.

835
01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:06,349
It'll work.

836
01:02:06,516 --> 01:02:08,977
Remember, Wink, they can smell fear.

837
01:02:19,446 --> 01:02:21,698
Settle, Genghis.

838
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,338
Oi!

839
01:02:37,797 --> 01:02:39,174
Told you it'd work.

840
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:42,510
How can you not love this face?

841
01:02:54,606 --> 01:02:55,649
It's you.

842
01:02:56,191 --> 01:02:59,277
It is. And you're reading about me.

843
01:02:59,486 --> 01:03:01,154
And you're in my shop.

844
01:03:02,155 --> 01:03:05,450
It's me, Estella.

845
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:11,790
Oh, my. My, my, my.
You look amazing.

846
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:15,752
You certainly made a splash.

847
01:03:16,503 --> 01:03:19,047
I'm just getting started, darling.

848
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:21,091
And I need help.

849
01:03:21,257 --> 01:03:23,927
I want to make art, Artie...

850
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:28,098
and I want to make trouble.
You in?

851
01:03:28,473 --> 01:03:30,100
I do love trouble.

852
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:33,561
I'm not the enemy!
Stop that!

853
01:03:33,728 --> 01:03:36,398
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, now. It's all right.

854
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:39,317
Hey! Hey, hey! Stop that! Hey!

855
01:03:39,484 --> 01:03:40,804
Hey! Stop! Hey!

856
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,196
Oh, come on! Those aren't yours!

857
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:49,661
You got them.

858
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:52,372
Artie, boys.
Boys, Artie.

859
01:03:52,539 --> 01:03:54,040
Artie will be working downstairs.

860
01:03:54,124 --> 01:03:56,042
He actually knows something
about fashion.

861
01:03:56,209 --> 01:03:57,210
Dogs are very aggressive.

862
01:03:57,377 --> 01:03:59,671
Well, you have to
walk them, feed them.

863
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:01,172
Get that necklace out.

864
01:04:01,339 --> 01:04:04,175
Yeah, well, can't you walk 'em as well?
There's no "I" in team.

865
01:04:04,342 --> 01:04:05,861
Well, there is an "I" in imbecile. Go!

866
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:07,846
Hey! No, no, no,
you can't talk to us like that.

867
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:09,097
We're helping you here.

868
01:04:09,264 --> 01:04:10,640
So don't.

869
01:04:13,143 --> 01:04:16,146
Oh.
Mummy and daddy are fighting.

870
01:04:16,855 --> 01:04:18,314
I'll, er, set up downstairs.

871
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:21,109
Just stop it.
Chill. Just chill.

872
01:04:23,862 --> 01:04:26,614
Come on, dogs. Regent's Park it is.

873
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:28,158
You could be more polite is all.

874
01:04:28,324 --> 01:04:29,492
I don't have time.

875
01:04:29,576 --> 01:04:31,369
I have to go to work.
I'm a designer now.

876
01:04:31,453 --> 01:04:32,454
Seriously?

877
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:34,998
Keep your enemies close.

878
01:04:35,749 --> 01:04:39,085
<i>Voilà!</i> Cruella was
in a box a long time,

879
01:04:39,252 --> 01:04:42,213
now Estella can be the one
who makes guest appearances.

880
01:04:45,258 --> 01:04:48,970
Everyone is laughing at me.

881
01:04:49,137 --> 01:04:52,223
Well, they say all press
is good press, Baroness.

882
01:04:52,807 --> 01:04:55,560
Although they have focused
rather on the rats.

883
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,730
Did you happen to notice her hair?

884
01:05:01,024 --> 01:05:02,108
Coincidence.

885
01:05:02,192 --> 01:05:04,194
Apparently, all the young people
are doing it now.

886
01:05:06,196 --> 01:05:09,532
Thank you, John.
You're such an enormous...

887
01:05:10,742 --> 01:05:11,785
help.

888
01:05:11,993 --> 01:05:13,495
- I do my best.
- Mmm.

889
01:05:14,913 --> 01:05:16,915
She wants you, hurry up.

890
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:19,209
Come on.

891
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:24,380
Ah. Here she is.

892
01:05:24,547 --> 01:05:26,716
Late. Grab a pad.

893
01:05:28,176 --> 01:05:29,219
Excuse me.

894
01:05:30,011 --> 01:05:31,930
<i>Fashion fact.
The pinnacle</i>

895
01:05:32,013 --> 01:05:34,599
<i>of every London fashion year
is the spring collection.</i>

896
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:35,767
Excuse me.

897
01:05:38,812 --> 01:05:40,188
My spring collection.

898
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:44,067
I need 12 pieces, and I have...

899
01:05:45,401 --> 01:05:46,486
Let me count.

900
01:05:50,907 --> 01:05:53,368
<i>I was going to take
the things she loved most...</i>

901
01:05:53,451 --> 01:05:54,744
<i>her business,</i>

902
01:05:56,871 --> 01:05:57,997
<i>her status...</i>

903
01:05:58,081 --> 01:05:59,124
Zero.

904
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:02,627
I need ten pieces that work by 3:00 a.m.

905
01:06:02,794 --> 01:06:04,504
<i>...her confidence.</i>

906
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:07,590
Go.

907
01:06:10,093 --> 01:06:11,094
Thank you.

908
01:06:11,177 --> 01:06:12,720
Gratitude's for losers.

909
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:15,765
Oh. Good advice, thanks.

910
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:16,891
What did I just say?

911
01:06:17,267 --> 01:06:19,067
Er, don't thank you, so...

912
01:06:19,144 --> 01:06:20,436
Got it. Thank you.

913
01:06:20,603 --> 01:06:23,231
- Go.
- Going. So, I'll just...

914
01:06:24,232 --> 01:06:25,441
Mmm?

915
01:06:25,942 --> 01:06:27,422
What do you mean, the dogs have gone?

916
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:29,154
Well, find them!

917
01:06:33,741 --> 01:06:36,119
Horace. Game's on.

918
01:06:36,286 --> 01:06:37,412
Oh, tournaments...

919
01:06:37,704 --> 01:06:40,790
Oh! You're killing me! You animals!

920
01:06:40,957 --> 01:06:43,042
I sleep on that thing.

921
01:06:43,209 --> 01:06:45,670
I'm watching the game. Forget it.

922
01:06:45,837 --> 01:06:47,881
Oh, Tottenham fans.

923
01:06:48,298 --> 01:06:50,091
So, you're not all bad then.

924
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:54,262
Two minutes. Necklace?

925
01:06:54,429 --> 01:06:57,724
No. But silence. That's a start.

926
01:06:58,266 --> 01:07:00,894
And, of course, "Thank you
for doing all my dirty work, guys."

927
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,730
"Hey, don't worry about it.
We're a team."

928
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:11,863
Baroness! Over here!

929
01:07:57,742 --> 01:08:00,411
"Cruella." Cruella.

930
01:08:00,828 --> 01:08:02,330
What sort of a name is that anyway?

931
01:08:02,413 --> 01:08:03,873
Okay. A proper competitor.

932
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,334
I'll just have to destroy her
as we have so many before.

933
01:08:06,501 --> 01:08:10,672
Find her. And, Roger,
find out everything about her.

934
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:17,053
I'm more a lawyer than a detective, I...

935
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:18,471
Yes, I'll do that.

936
01:08:47,959 --> 01:08:51,254
We have no signature piece.

937
01:08:52,005 --> 01:08:55,925
And this Cruella person is everywhere.

938
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:58,803
I want ideas.

939
01:09:00,346 --> 01:09:02,974
Estella, what've you got?

940
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:14,902
You seem upset.

941
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:18,281
My dogs are missing,
my necklace has been stolen

942
01:09:18,448 --> 01:09:21,659
and this Cruella creature is...

943
01:09:23,286 --> 01:09:24,871
This show has to be the best.

944
01:09:25,038 --> 01:09:28,583
Can I get you some cucumber?
Thinly sliced.

945
01:09:32,962 --> 01:09:34,088
Go.

946
01:09:34,255 --> 01:09:38,551
And get your dried-up,
desiccated little brain working.

947
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,720
Of course. And thank you.

948
01:09:51,814 --> 01:09:55,651
Yes, go to lunch, you lazy fools.

949
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:04,869
Hmm.

950
01:10:19,675 --> 01:10:21,302
What? Hey!

951
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:26,474
Mmm.

952
01:10:26,557 --> 01:10:29,727
Oh, Estella, I am surprised at you
holding out on me.

953
01:10:30,395 --> 01:10:32,688
But I was on my lunch break
in a public space.

954
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:34,273
Yes, I own the alley.

955
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,526
Really? You can own alleys?

956
01:10:37,443 --> 01:10:40,321
Alleys, designs, people, their souls.

957
01:10:42,198 --> 01:10:43,866
Check your employment contract.

958
01:10:50,373 --> 01:10:53,167
Well, I seem to have found
my new signature piece.

959
01:10:54,544 --> 01:10:55,878
How do you like it?

960
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,059
We need to sue her, for defamation,

961
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:54,687
false imprisonment, vandalism.
Something.

962
01:11:54,854 --> 01:11:59,275
Well, having been through the statute
and talked to the police,

963
01:11:59,442 --> 01:12:02,111
I don't know we have a legal avenue
for...

964
01:12:02,278 --> 01:12:04,405
I need you to stop talking, Roger.

965
01:12:04,572 --> 01:12:05,573
You do?

966
01:12:05,781 --> 01:12:07,575
So I have a gap to fire you.

967
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,953
There's a gap. You're fired.

968
01:12:11,162 --> 01:12:13,831
<i>Roger always blamed me
for getting him fired,</i>

969
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,876
<i>but the real reason
Roger was fired is because...</i>

970
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:18,586
- Hmm.
<i>- ...he's Roger.</i>

971
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:26,844
You'll need more than eyeliner,
you plain little thing.

972
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:30,515
You do, however,
have an eye for a good shot.

973
01:12:30,598 --> 01:12:31,641
Baroness.

974
01:12:31,766 --> 01:12:33,851
Who is she?
And, more importantly, where is she?

975
01:12:34,393 --> 01:12:35,603
I don't know.

976
01:12:40,858 --> 01:12:42,693
Did you just lie to me?

977
01:12:44,529 --> 01:12:46,197
I... No, I...

978
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:48,699
- Don't cry.
- I'm not.

979
01:12:54,789 --> 01:12:56,165
You will.

980
01:13:18,646 --> 01:13:19,855
Getting anything?

981
01:13:19,939 --> 01:13:21,023
Come on!

982
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:22,858
- Nothing?
- Nothing!

983
01:13:23,693 --> 01:13:25,570
You know, I'm worried about her.

984
01:13:25,736 --> 01:13:27,321
What, Estella?

985
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:28,698
Yeah.

986
01:13:28,864 --> 01:13:30,658
Oh, she's just playing a part
for the grift.

987
01:13:30,825 --> 01:13:32,994
Rude part.
Hey! Stop that!

988
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:37,498
Where's the beading for the dress?

989
01:13:37,665 --> 01:13:41,335
Ordered. Just waiting
on this idiot delivery man.

990
01:13:46,882 --> 01:13:48,718
Oh, good day to you, missy.

991
01:13:48,884 --> 01:13:50,970
Got some fashion items
that are most fashionable.

992
01:13:51,929 --> 01:13:54,807
Thank you, most handsome delivery man.

993
01:14:38,142 --> 01:14:39,185
It's...

994
01:14:40,436 --> 01:14:41,937
Stunning.

995
01:14:43,564 --> 01:14:44,690
Hmm.

996
01:14:46,859 --> 01:14:48,444
I've done it again.

997
01:14:49,528 --> 01:14:51,405
Let's go make history.

998
01:14:52,198 --> 01:14:55,242
I need a drink. Estella, come.

999
01:15:14,011 --> 01:15:15,429
Give it to me, for heaven's sake.

1000
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:19,350
Go.

1001
01:15:27,316 --> 01:15:28,651
Here's to me.

1002
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:36,450
Who the hell else would I drink to?

1003
01:15:38,285 --> 01:15:39,453
To me?

1004
01:15:40,329 --> 01:15:42,289
For creating your signature piece?

1005
01:15:42,998 --> 01:15:44,875
You're helpful to me, is all.

1006
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:47,753
As soon as you're not, you're dust.

1007
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,505
Inspiring talk.

1008
01:15:50,172 --> 01:15:51,465
Thank you.

1009
01:16:01,726 --> 01:16:05,104
You can't care about anyone else.

1010
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:07,189
Everyone else is an obstacle.

1011
01:16:07,815 --> 01:16:10,943
You care what an obstacle
wants or feels, you're dead.

1012
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:12,987
If I had cared about anyone or thing,

1013
01:16:13,154 --> 01:16:15,239
I might have died,
like so many brilliant women,

1014
01:16:15,406 --> 01:16:21,579
with a drawer full of unseen genius
and a heart full of sad bitterness.

1015
01:16:22,288 --> 01:16:24,749
You have the talent for your own label.

1016
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:29,420
Whether you have the killer instinct
is the big question.

1017
01:16:35,176 --> 01:16:37,553
I hope I do.

1018
01:16:38,262 --> 01:16:39,305
Hmm.

1019
01:16:40,681 --> 01:16:43,017
Correct response. Well done.

1020
01:16:45,561 --> 01:16:47,730
We just have to get rid of this...

1021
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:50,733
Cruella person, don't you think?

1022
01:16:51,817 --> 01:16:52,860
Hmm.

1023
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:55,571
I guess you must hate her.

1024
01:16:56,572 --> 01:16:58,240
Honestly?

1025
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:00,075
I'm conflicted.

1026
01:17:00,242 --> 01:17:02,077
She is good.

1027
01:17:02,286 --> 01:17:03,454
Bold and brilliant.

1028
01:17:05,873 --> 01:17:08,083
But she has made it me or her...

1029
01:17:11,921 --> 01:17:14,048
and I choose me.

1030
01:17:23,891 --> 01:17:27,436
Wow, this guy's
a bit of a blanket.

1031
01:17:28,562 --> 01:17:30,189
What about...

1032
01:17:31,232 --> 01:17:32,233
this?

1033
01:17:39,365 --> 01:17:40,950
Really?

1034
01:17:41,617 --> 01:17:44,119
We're gonna
have to get invasive.

1035
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:51,335
It's risky.

1036
01:17:52,044 --> 01:17:54,588
They gotta know we broke in,
Cruella said.

1037
01:17:55,548 --> 01:17:58,509
Yeah, she did, didn't she?

1038
01:17:59,885 --> 01:18:01,720
Yeah, I'm getting
a little tired of Cruella.

1039
01:18:01,887 --> 01:18:02,972
Oh, yeah.

1040
01:18:27,121 --> 01:18:28,747
What's going on?

1041
01:18:32,251 --> 01:18:33,878
She tried to break in last night.

1042
01:18:34,545 --> 01:18:35,713
Who did?

1043
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,506
Cruella. Well, it makes sense.

1044
01:18:38,549 --> 01:18:40,885
It's a stunning,
ludicrously expensive gown.

1045
01:18:40,968 --> 01:18:42,553
Cruella could never afford to make it.

1046
01:18:42,636 --> 01:18:43,721
Hmm.

1047
01:18:43,804 --> 01:18:46,640
But Cruella has no shame.

1048
01:18:46,807 --> 01:18:48,559
She may steal my creation.

1049
01:18:48,642 --> 01:18:51,604
I mean, that's a very good idea, right,
if you were...

1050
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,230
her?

1051
01:19:17,963 --> 01:19:22,343
Night. Get some sleep.
Big day tomorrow.

1052
01:19:22,509 --> 01:19:24,309
Play nice, guys.

1053
01:19:26,138 --> 01:19:27,139
Night.

1054
01:19:46,909 --> 01:19:47,993
What?

1055
01:19:49,244 --> 01:19:50,245
I miss Estella.

1056
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:53,832
Goal!

1057
01:19:56,627 --> 01:19:59,088
They really would make fabulous coats.

1058
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:00,297
The dogs?

1059
01:20:05,803 --> 01:20:06,804
I'm joking.

1060
01:20:07,972 --> 01:20:09,765
You know what I miss?

1061
01:20:09,848 --> 01:20:11,284
The Jasper who had a sense of humour.

1062
01:20:11,308 --> 01:20:12,309
Right.

1063
01:20:12,476 --> 01:20:14,287
You know, we've all had
bad things happen to us.

1064
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:16,563
Me, him, you. But we've always
been there for each other.

1065
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:19,942
That's all I'm asking.
Is it so hard to back me up?

1066
01:20:20,109 --> 01:20:24,321
No. Not Estella, that's easy.
But to help Cruella,

1067
01:20:25,155 --> 01:20:26,198
it's a nightmare.

1068
01:20:26,365 --> 01:20:29,410
And there's that
understatement thing you do.

1069
01:20:29,618 --> 01:20:31,745
Cruella gets things done.

1070
01:20:31,912 --> 01:20:33,497
Estella does not.

1071
01:20:33,664 --> 01:20:35,708
And I have things to do.

1072
01:20:35,874 --> 01:20:37,584
So if you're done chatting.

1073
01:20:40,212 --> 01:20:41,797
And by "if" I mean you are.

1074
01:21:02,735 --> 01:21:04,194
I'll allow it.

1075
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:27,051
When Estella arrives,

1076
01:21:27,134 --> 01:21:29,094
escort her to my office
and hold her there.

1077
01:21:29,261 --> 01:21:30,262
Very good.

1078
01:21:31,388 --> 01:21:33,974
Although I think you're wrong.
It's not her.

1079
01:21:34,141 --> 01:21:36,602
Do I pay you for your opinions
or for your obedience?

1080
01:21:37,144 --> 01:21:38,729
Well, are you asking my opinion?

1081
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,441
I'll see it's done.

1082
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:00,417
Speak.

1083
01:22:01,668 --> 01:22:03,962
What do you mean, it's stuck?

1084
01:22:04,046 --> 01:22:06,048
The guests are already arriving.

1085
01:22:06,131 --> 01:22:07,257
Oh!

1086
01:22:07,549 --> 01:22:10,135
There's something wrong with the lock,
Your Ladyship.

1087
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:13,138
I don't care what you have to do,
get it open!

1088
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:11,905
That little...

1089
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:30,966
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1090
01:23:31,717 --> 01:23:33,844
<i>I present to you...</i>

1091
01:23:41,935 --> 01:23:43,979
<i>Cruella!</i>

1092
01:24:17,137 --> 01:24:18,263
It's got a good beat.

1093
01:24:21,141 --> 01:24:22,142
The music.

1094
01:24:53,674 --> 01:24:55,676
She killed my dogs.

1095
01:24:59,137 --> 01:25:02,766
And made a coat.

1096
01:25:24,746 --> 01:25:26,331
Oi! Get out! Come on!

1097
01:25:30,711 --> 01:25:33,005
Oh, how lovely of her
to thank us for our work.

1098
01:25:33,171 --> 01:25:34,715
Yeah, real gracious, wasn't she?

1099
01:25:38,677 --> 01:25:39,821
After all we've done for her.

1100
01:25:39,845 --> 01:25:42,245
Whatever happened to that cute
little girl crying on a bench?

1101
01:25:42,306 --> 01:25:43,432
She's gone, mate.

1102
01:25:46,184 --> 01:25:48,520
We should've left her
on that park bench.

1103
01:25:56,403 --> 01:25:57,612
Madam, welcome.

1104
01:25:57,696 --> 01:26:00,115
- Mmm. Hello.
- Anything I can get you, please?

1105
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:02,409
- Oh, er, two lamb korma.
- Okay.

1106
01:26:02,576 --> 01:26:04,578
One tandoori chicken,
and rice all round.

1107
01:26:04,786 --> 01:26:05,829
No problem. No problem.

1108
01:26:05,996 --> 01:26:09,374
<i>A fashion riot in Regent's Park
broke out today.</i>

1109
01:26:09,624 --> 01:26:12,294
<i>Cruella,
some call her a designer,</i>

1110
01:26:12,377 --> 01:26:13,837
<i>- others a vandal.</i>
- Hmm.

1111
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,258
<i>Questions are being raised over
whether her coat was real Dalmatian.</i>

1112
01:26:18,425 --> 01:26:20,510
Madam, are you celebrating?

1113
01:26:20,677 --> 01:26:22,929
Oh, indeed I am.

1114
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:35,650
The queen is dead!

1115
01:26:37,277 --> 01:26:40,364
Long live the queen.

1116
01:26:47,412 --> 01:26:48,705
Cruella.

1117
01:26:48,789 --> 01:26:49,873
Wow.

1118
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:52,751
You really are a psycho.

1119
01:26:54,086 --> 01:26:56,254
Why, how nice of you to say.

1120
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:58,590
You showed promise,

1121
01:26:59,633 --> 01:27:02,886
as did Estella.

1122
01:27:03,428 --> 01:27:05,931
Oh, am I late for work?

1123
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:08,850
Gee whiz, boss, how was the show?

1124
01:27:11,019 --> 01:27:12,270
This is between us.

1125
01:27:13,063 --> 01:27:15,357
Let Jasper and Horace,
imbeciles that they are

1126
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,984
for letting you follow them,
let them go.

1127
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:22,364
Oh, I shall. They're going to jail.

1128
01:27:22,531 --> 01:27:23,657
For what?

1129
01:27:24,491 --> 01:27:25,492
Dognapping?

1130
01:27:25,909 --> 01:27:26,993
Your murder.

1131
01:27:29,913 --> 01:27:31,415
No one will believe that.

1132
01:27:31,915 --> 01:27:35,210
Well, I'll have to add your
charred body to the mix

1133
01:27:35,377 --> 01:27:38,797
to help the believability factor.

1134
01:27:39,589 --> 01:27:40,590
Almost.

1135
01:27:44,344 --> 01:27:46,179
Come on, you. Come on.

1136
01:27:46,346 --> 01:27:47,722
Oh, that's nice.

1137
01:27:49,307 --> 01:27:51,601
You're going to kill me
because I upstaged you?

1138
01:27:53,687 --> 01:27:54,688
Uh-huh.

1139
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:01,570
I know you killed my mother.

1140
01:28:01,736 --> 01:28:04,239
You're going to have to be
more specific.

1141
01:28:04,406 --> 01:28:05,782
What?

1142
01:28:07,701 --> 01:28:09,536
Who exactly?

1143
01:28:10,162 --> 01:28:12,289
Just narrow it down for me.

1144
01:28:12,706 --> 01:28:13,707
On a cliff.

1145
01:28:14,833 --> 01:28:16,209
You called your dogs on her.

1146
01:28:17,127 --> 01:28:20,088
Okay. Now I'm with you.

1147
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:22,382
Oh, that's why you're peeved.

1148
01:28:23,216 --> 01:28:25,510
Hence this little show.

1149
01:28:27,137 --> 01:28:31,308
I'm gonna kill you. And your dogs.

1150
01:28:34,769 --> 01:28:36,062
I'm waiting.

1151
01:28:40,901 --> 01:28:41,985
Gents,

1152
01:28:44,654 --> 01:28:47,073
will you let me go for a moment?

1153
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,243
Come on.
I'm sure she's a terrible boss.

1154
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:53,205
Enough.

1155
01:29:05,717 --> 01:29:07,052
Goodbye, Cruella.

1156
01:29:12,599 --> 01:29:13,600
Dogs.

1157
01:29:20,232 --> 01:29:21,691
Bad dog, Genghis.

1158
01:29:21,858 --> 01:29:23,109
I'll tip off the press.

1159
01:29:23,276 --> 01:29:26,488
I'd love them to know
that you went out in a

1160
01:29:27,781 --> 01:29:28,949
blaze of glory.

1161
01:30:11,449 --> 01:30:13,702
Hold it there. Up there.

1162
01:30:17,956 --> 01:30:19,666
Move back!
It's still a dangerous scene.

1163
01:30:19,749 --> 01:30:21,029
Please, I need you to move back.

1164
01:30:22,294 --> 01:30:23,628
<i>Breaking news,</i>

1165
01:30:23,795 --> 01:30:27,424
<i>Cruella, best known for upstaging
the Baroness in the fashion world,</i>

1166
01:30:27,591 --> 01:30:28,800

in London's West End fashion scene</i>

1171

<i>has tragically died tonight
in a warehouse fire.</i>

1172
01:30:54,868 --> 01:30:55,869
What?

1173
01:31:00,915 --> 01:31:01,916
Tea, Miss Cruella?

1174
01:31:03,335 --> 01:31:04,586
Why am I alive?

1175
01:31:04,753 --> 01:31:06,647
Because I dragged you
out of the smoke and flames

1176
01:31:06,671 --> 01:31:07,714
before they consumed you.

1177
01:31:13,136 --> 01:31:14,638
I have something for you.

1178
01:31:22,687 --> 01:31:23,897
You found it?

1179
01:31:24,064 --> 01:31:25,190
In the fire.

1180
01:31:26,733 --> 01:31:30,487
I can assure you it's been,
er, thoroughly bleached.

1181
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,281
May I show you something?

1182
01:31:39,537 --> 01:31:41,539
I didn't know it had a key.

1183
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:43,333
Mmm-hmm.

1184
01:31:45,293 --> 01:31:46,586
What's it to?

1185
01:31:47,253 --> 01:31:48,421
This.

1186
01:32:05,814 --> 01:32:07,649
The Baroness has a kid?

1187
01:32:08,525 --> 01:32:09,818
You.

1188
01:32:13,738 --> 01:32:15,031
May I walk you through it?

1189
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:19,285
<i>The Baron was a sweet old guy.</i>

1190
01:32:20,537 --> 01:32:23,248
<i>The Baroness, on the other hand,
she's a true narcissist.</i>

1191
01:32:25,542 --> 01:32:27,377
<i>So, when she found out
she was pregnant...</i>

1192
01:32:27,544 --> 01:32:28,670
I'm pregnant.

1193
01:32:28,753 --> 01:32:30,255
<i>...she wasn't
exactly thrilled.</i>

1194
01:32:31,756 --> 01:32:33,258
<i>The Baron was delighted.</i>

1195
01:32:33,425 --> 01:32:36,219
<i>So much so that he surprised her
by giving her a family heirloom.</i>

1196
01:32:36,553 --> 01:32:39,055
<i>She took the necklace,
but she had other plans for you.</i>

1197
01:32:39,139 --> 01:32:40,140
<i>Stop.</i>

1198
01:32:41,099 --> 01:32:42,308
You keep saying "you."

1199
01:32:42,475 --> 01:32:44,602
You are her daughter.

1200
01:32:45,228 --> 01:32:47,063
I was there when you were born.

1201
01:32:47,564 --> 01:32:50,404
<i>The Baron was away on business and
she ordered me to do the unthinkable.</i>

1202
01:32:50,442 --> 01:32:51,484
You know what to do.

1203
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,446
<i>It was a diabolical request.</i>

1204
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:57,991
<i>I knew I needed to protect you.
But how?</i>

1205
01:32:59,033 --> 01:33:00,744
<i>Then I saw Catherine,</i>

1206
01:33:00,827 --> 01:33:02,662
<i>the sweetest woman
who ever lived.</i>

1207
01:33:02,871 --> 01:33:04,372
<i>She saved you.</i>

1208
01:33:05,123 --> 01:33:07,542
The Baroness said the child had died.

1209
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:13,673
The Baron, he, er, wasted away.

1210
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,093
The point I'm making is,

1211
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:21,097
you are the rightful heir
to the Baron's entire fortune.

1212
01:33:21,473 --> 01:33:24,768
The mansion, the title. Everything.

1213
01:33:24,934 --> 01:33:27,645
That psycho cannot be my mother.

1214
01:33:30,064 --> 01:33:31,065
No.

1215
01:33:45,914 --> 01:33:46,915
Oi!

1216
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,662
So, this is a confusing day.

1217
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:12,208
My nemesis

1218
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:15,837
is my real mother

1219
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:21,426
and she killed my other mother.

1220
01:35:25,305 --> 01:35:27,307
I guess you were always scared,

1221
01:35:28,182 --> 01:35:32,478
weren't you, that I'd be a psycho

1222
01:35:33,897 --> 01:35:35,815
like my real mum?

1223
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:37,734
Hmm?

1224
01:35:40,612 --> 01:35:45,617
That explains all the
"tone it down, try and fit in" stuff.

1225
01:35:47,493 --> 01:35:52,123
Love me into shape,
I suppose, was the plan.

1226
01:36:00,673 --> 01:36:02,050
And I tried.

1227
01:36:03,009 --> 01:36:06,804
I really... I tried because

1228
01:36:08,431 --> 01:36:09,974
I loved you.

1229
01:36:14,812 --> 01:36:16,397
But the thing is...

1230
01:36:18,983 --> 01:36:20,234
I'm...

1231
01:36:21,611 --> 01:36:25,740
not sweet Estella,

1232
01:36:27,283 --> 01:36:28,743
try as I might.

1233
01:36:31,955 --> 01:36:33,164
I never was.

1234
01:36:39,212 --> 01:36:40,755
I'm Cruella,

1235
01:36:43,508 --> 01:36:46,094
born brilliant,

1236
01:36:47,345 --> 01:36:48,846
born bad

1237
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,184
and a little bit mad.

1238
01:36:58,022 --> 01:36:59,774
I am not like her.

1239
01:37:03,069 --> 01:37:04,612
I'm better.

1240
01:37:07,991 --> 01:37:09,158
Anyway,

1241
01:37:10,618 --> 01:37:11,911
must dash.

1242
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:15,665
Much to avenge, revenge and destroy.

1243
01:37:25,675 --> 01:37:28,094
But I do love you.

1244
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:32,432
Always.

1245
01:37:41,983 --> 01:37:45,153
The boys are locked up,
but we have a problem.

1246
01:37:45,319 --> 01:37:47,613
I don't pay you for problems.

1247
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:49,741
We didn't find her body.

1248
01:37:49,907 --> 01:37:50,968
What are you talking about?

1249
01:37:50,992 --> 01:37:52,869
It's on the TV, the radio.

1250
01:37:53,036 --> 01:37:55,705
Well, someone tipped them off

1251
01:37:55,872 --> 01:37:57,290
and gave them the wrong tip.

1252
01:38:02,503 --> 01:38:04,130
Thank you for your time.

1253
01:38:04,297 --> 01:38:06,549
Incompetent as always.

1254
01:38:22,523 --> 01:38:26,527
You're in the way.

1255
01:38:42,627 --> 01:38:44,629
I still can't believe she's dead.

1256
01:38:47,006 --> 01:38:50,051
Pull it together, H.
You can't cry in prison.

1257
01:38:50,968 --> 01:38:52,220
Yeah.

1258
01:38:52,386 --> 01:38:54,097
Let's just remember Estella.

1259
01:38:54,263 --> 01:38:55,515
- Estella.
- Estella.

1260
01:38:55,681 --> 01:38:56,724
No crying.

1261
01:38:56,891 --> 01:38:58,392
Forget Cruella.

1262
01:39:09,821 --> 01:39:11,072
Shh!

1263
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:13,658
Did you hear that?

1264
01:39:14,575 --> 01:39:16,369
I heard something.

1265
01:39:44,438 --> 01:39:45,857
Oi, come here!

1266
01:39:50,528 --> 01:39:52,809
Stay behind and
keep an eye on the prisoners!

1267
01:40:06,002 --> 01:40:07,003
What?

1268
01:40:07,211 --> 01:40:08,296
Hey.

1269
01:40:09,714 --> 01:40:11,048
- Wink!
- Shh!

1270
01:40:11,215 --> 01:40:12,216
Wink!

1271
01:40:13,176 --> 01:40:15,219
You ain't barbecued!

1272
01:40:16,053 --> 01:40:17,388
What in the bloody...

1273
01:40:17,847 --> 01:40:18,931
Thank you.

1274
01:40:19,098 --> 01:40:21,225
You're getting kissed
right on the mouth!

1275
01:40:21,392 --> 01:40:22,852
I don't care where it's been!

1276
01:41:20,451 --> 01:41:21,452
Want a ride?

1277
01:41:21,619 --> 01:41:23,663
- Yeah, we'll walk, thanks.
- You're alive!

1278
01:41:23,746 --> 01:41:24,747
Oi!

1279
01:41:24,914 --> 01:41:26,808
Yeah, I've had enough
of being treated like a dog,

1280
01:41:26,832 --> 01:41:28,668
thank you.
No offence, Wink.

1281
01:41:28,834 --> 01:41:30,294
You'll get caught by the cops.

1282
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:32,773
We did fine before you showed up,
we'll do fine without you.

1283
01:41:32,797 --> 01:41:33,798
Yeah, exactly.

1284
01:41:33,881 --> 01:41:34,924
I fancy a fry-up.

1285
01:41:35,091 --> 01:41:37,402
- Yeah, I fancy a fry-up without her.
- Yeah, me too.

1286
01:41:37,426 --> 01:41:39,053
There's no easy way to say this.

1287
01:41:42,974 --> 01:41:44,767
The Baroness is my birth mother.

1288
01:41:51,274 --> 01:41:52,984
You just blew my mind.

1289
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:55,111
It does explain a lot.

1290
01:41:55,945 --> 01:41:58,531
She gave me away to die.

1291
01:41:59,699 --> 01:42:02,576
And then killed the sweetest woman,

1292
01:42:02,743 --> 01:42:04,078
albeit a liar,

1293
01:42:04,245 --> 01:42:05,663
who ever lived.

1294
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,671
Well, thank you for the crumpets
and the crazy story.

1295
01:42:14,213 --> 01:42:15,756
Good luck with that.

1296
01:42:15,923 --> 01:42:17,609
- I might take a few of these.
- Jasper!

1297
01:42:17,633 --> 01:42:19,468
We're in a kill-or-be-killed
situation here.

1298
01:42:19,635 --> 01:42:22,596
Yeah, and she's a homicidal maniac,
and you're not.

1299
01:42:22,763 --> 01:42:25,975
Well, we don't know that yet.
I'm still young.

1300
01:42:26,809 --> 01:42:28,060
It's funny.

1301
01:42:28,144 --> 01:42:29,913
Or it would be,
if I knew you were being funny.

1302
01:42:29,937 --> 01:42:30,938
No, not funny.

1303
01:42:31,022 --> 01:42:32,440
I'm joking, I'm joking!

1304
01:42:32,606 --> 01:42:34,900
The point is, I can't run.

1305
01:42:35,067 --> 01:42:37,778
She'll find me, Jasper.
You know she will.

1306
01:42:38,237 --> 01:42:39,280
We have to stop her.

1307
01:42:43,743 --> 01:42:45,328
I went a bit mad.

1308
01:42:46,454 --> 01:42:47,872
I'm sorry.

1309
01:42:50,416 --> 01:42:52,335
You're my family.

1310
01:42:54,837 --> 01:42:56,130
All I have.

1311
01:43:02,553 --> 01:43:04,805
- She used the family card.
- Yeah, she did.

1312
01:43:05,389 --> 01:43:06,432
It's working.

1313
01:43:06,599 --> 01:43:08,642
Yeah. All right, fine.

1314
01:43:10,561 --> 01:43:11,896
So, what's the plan?

1315
01:43:16,817 --> 01:43:19,528
The Baroness' charity gala
is this weekend.

1316
01:43:20,404 --> 01:43:22,799
We're going to need the home addresses
and measurements of all the guests.

1317
01:43:22,823 --> 01:43:23,824
Easy.

1318
01:43:24,075 --> 01:43:25,951
Artie's tribe of dressmakers, of course.

1319
01:43:26,535 --> 01:43:27,536
I like him.

1320
01:43:27,703 --> 01:43:29,413
A black cape, pots of paint.

1321
01:43:29,497 --> 01:43:30,498
Oh, yeah?

1322
01:43:30,664 --> 01:43:31,832
Several boned corsets...

1323
01:43:31,999 --> 01:43:33,459
Should we write this down?

1324
01:43:35,294 --> 01:43:37,296
I'm sorry.
I didn't realise there'd be company.

1325
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:39,924
John, this is my family.

1326
01:43:40,674 --> 01:43:41,884
They'll be staying a while.

1327
01:43:42,051 --> 01:43:43,386
Hiya.

1328
01:43:44,011 --> 01:43:45,763
You're out of crumpets.

1329
01:43:56,065 --> 01:43:58,526
We're closed.

1330
01:44:01,404 --> 01:44:03,131
I was just reading about you,

1331
01:44:03,155 --> 01:44:04,824
the puppy killer.

1332
01:44:04,990 --> 01:44:07,034
Oh, well, I do love spots.

1333
01:44:07,493 --> 01:44:08,869
You didn't.

1334
01:44:09,453 --> 01:44:10,621
I didn't.

1335
01:44:11,247 --> 01:44:13,124
But people do need a villain
to believe in,

1336
01:44:13,290 --> 01:44:14,917
so I'm happy to fit the bill.

1337
01:44:15,126 --> 01:44:16,544
Fabulous.

1338
01:44:18,587 --> 01:44:20,506
Small point, aren't you dead?

1339
01:44:20,673 --> 01:44:22,883
I am. Yes.

1340
01:44:23,050 --> 01:44:24,427
Sad, really.

1341
01:44:25,136 --> 01:44:26,512
But also helpful.

1342
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:30,015
Now, Artie, I have a plan.

1343
01:44:30,182 --> 01:44:31,559
Of course you do.

1344
01:44:31,725 --> 01:44:33,269
And you're going to help me with it.

1345
01:44:33,436 --> 01:44:35,020
Mmm. What do I get?

1346
01:44:35,646 --> 01:44:39,400
A night of fabulousness
and mayhem and possible death.

1347
01:44:39,567 --> 01:44:42,653
Check, check, not quite sure
about the death though.

1348
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:44,071
It won't be you.

1349
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:45,489
Mmm. I'll get my coat.

1350
01:45:36,624 --> 01:45:37,833
For me?

1351
01:45:58,395 --> 01:45:59,522
Heya.

1352
01:46:05,486 --> 01:46:06,529
Sorry.

1353
01:46:10,741 --> 01:46:11,784
Big night.

1354
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:13,369
Indeed it is.

1355
01:46:14,078 --> 01:46:15,162
Sure about this?

1356
01:46:20,793 --> 01:46:22,336
No, I'm being serious.

1357
01:46:22,503 --> 01:46:23,921
And you're cute when you are.

1358
01:46:25,381 --> 01:46:26,465
Okay.

1359
01:46:29,051 --> 01:46:30,052
I know you're in pain.

1360
01:46:30,261 --> 01:46:31,428
Mmm.

1361
01:46:31,512 --> 01:46:33,222
And I know that she caused it,

1362
01:46:35,391 --> 01:46:37,810
but, you know, killing her
is not gonna make that go away.

1363
01:46:41,814 --> 01:46:43,107
I won't.

1364
01:46:45,109 --> 01:46:46,110
I promise.

1365
01:46:46,193 --> 01:46:47,611
All right, cool. Groovy.

1366
01:46:49,697 --> 01:46:51,782
Unless I really, really have to.

1367
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:58,914
Thanks for helping me.

1368
01:47:00,541 --> 01:47:03,168
Yeah, well, I find it very difficult
to say no to you sometimes.

1369
01:47:06,213 --> 01:47:08,173
It's one of the things I love about you.

1370
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:10,551
Thanks?

1371
01:47:17,141 --> 01:47:19,768
When I fixed it,
I noticed a name.

1372
01:47:19,935 --> 01:47:21,854
Do you know what this car's called?

1373
01:47:22,896 --> 01:47:24,106
A Devil!

1374
01:47:25,399 --> 01:47:26,859
It's DeVille, mate.

1375
01:47:27,693 --> 01:47:28,736
DeVille.

1376
01:47:30,362 --> 01:47:31,864
I like that.

1377
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:38,162
Come on. Stand to attention.

1378
01:47:38,329 --> 01:47:39,830
Stand up straight.

1379
01:47:39,913 --> 01:47:40,914
Good.

1380
01:47:40,998 --> 01:47:41,999
It's time.

1381
01:47:50,424 --> 01:47:51,634
Psst!

1382
01:47:56,472 --> 01:48:00,351
When I said, all those years ago,
"Take care of it,"

1383
01:48:00,517 --> 01:48:02,603
what did you think I meant?

1384
01:48:03,062 --> 01:48:04,938
Well, I was a little confused.

1385
01:48:05,814 --> 01:48:07,858
I hardly thought you meant

1386
01:48:08,025 --> 01:48:10,027
you wanted me to kill your only child.

1387
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,615
And I thought

1388
01:48:14,698 --> 01:48:16,825
we knew each other.

1389
01:48:19,536 --> 01:48:20,663
Well?

1390
01:48:20,829 --> 01:48:22,790
I hope, for your sake,
she's hidden in your coat.

1391
01:48:23,415 --> 01:48:24,416
No, Baroness.

1392
01:48:28,754 --> 01:48:30,130
George, come here.

1393
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:37,262
She'll be here tonight.

1394
01:48:37,346 --> 01:48:38,889
I want her caught before she's seen.

1395
01:48:39,056 --> 01:48:40,724
Everyone thinks she's dead.

1396
01:48:40,891 --> 01:48:42,811
She'd better be that way
by the end of the night.

1397
01:48:42,976 --> 01:48:45,521
I've got a special treat for her.

1398
01:48:45,688 --> 01:48:48,190
It'll put a shock through her
and leave her incapacitated.

1399
01:48:48,982 --> 01:48:50,150
Give it to me.

1400
01:48:53,362 --> 01:48:54,822
Hmm.

1401
01:48:56,115 --> 01:48:57,491
That's marvellous.

1402
01:48:59,410 --> 01:49:02,204
Oh, I could do that all day!

1403
01:49:02,746 --> 01:49:04,623
Oh! Just find her, you idiots!

1404
01:49:11,672 --> 01:49:14,883
Why am I the only one who's competent?

1405
01:49:16,009 --> 01:49:17,219
Must be very tiring.

1406
01:49:19,346 --> 01:49:21,682
Should be a memorable night tonight,
Baroness.

1407
01:49:21,849 --> 01:49:23,600
Indeed it should.

1408
01:49:37,781 --> 01:49:40,617
All right, boys, look alert.
First vehicle arriving.

1409
01:49:47,624 --> 01:49:49,293
Blimey, it's her.

1410
01:49:52,671 --> 01:49:54,882
- Oh.
- I beg your pardon?

1411
01:49:55,048 --> 01:49:56,383
It's not her.

1412
01:49:58,635 --> 01:49:59,970
Here she is, here.

1413
01:50:03,265 --> 01:50:04,683
That's not her.

1414
01:50:07,478 --> 01:50:09,438
- How dare you touch me!
- Sorry, ma'am.

1415
01:50:09,605 --> 01:50:11,273
What's going on?

1416
01:50:11,857 --> 01:50:14,276
Time for my entrance, my dears.

1417
01:50:14,443 --> 01:50:15,944
- Baroness, I...
- Is she here?

1418
01:50:16,111 --> 01:50:17,551
Well, that's the problem, see, er...

1419
01:50:20,407 --> 01:50:21,575
Police. How can I help?

1420
01:50:21,742 --> 01:50:24,745
There's a robbery planned
for Hellman Hall this evening.

1421
01:50:24,912 --> 01:50:26,580
<i>Who is this?</i>

1422
01:50:40,636 --> 01:50:42,405
<i>All teams, Baroness requires</i>

1423
01:50:42,429 --> 01:50:44,139
<i>everybody in the library now.</i>

1424
01:50:44,306 --> 01:50:45,766
<i>She's angry, boys.</i>

1425
01:51:11,959 --> 01:51:14,336
I was just looking for the loo.

1426
01:51:15,838 --> 01:51:16,880
Shh.

1427
01:51:17,923 --> 01:51:19,383
Oh.

1428
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:11,852
Thank you all for coming.

1429
01:52:14,062 --> 01:52:16,773
What a great tribute to our dear friend

1430
01:52:19,276 --> 01:52:22,362
who shall never return.

1431
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:24,823
Sadly.

1432
01:52:26,199 --> 01:52:27,409
Touching.

1433
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:29,828
- To Cruella.
- To Cruella!

1434
01:52:29,995 --> 01:52:31,455
Bravo!

1435
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:58,482
That dog is like a son to me.

1436
01:52:58,565 --> 01:52:59,566
You're dead!

1437
01:53:03,278 --> 01:53:04,321
I had him.

1438
01:53:04,488 --> 01:53:06,448
Did you, though?

1439
01:53:19,544 --> 01:53:20,545
Where is she?

1440
01:53:20,712 --> 01:53:22,339
Didn't you just toast her death?

1441
01:53:48,657 --> 01:53:50,867
Where are my guards?

1442
01:54:26,737 --> 01:54:30,240
She's here. I can feel it.

1443
01:54:32,534 --> 01:54:34,244
Find her.

1444
01:54:52,929 --> 01:54:54,473
Push!

1445
01:56:03,125 --> 01:56:04,167
Get her!

1446
01:56:12,551 --> 01:56:13,885
Sit.

1447
01:56:34,614 --> 01:56:37,284
Hello, Cruella.

1448
01:56:38,076 --> 01:56:41,872
I hate to ruin your party,
but I've come to evict you.

1449
01:56:43,456 --> 01:56:45,584
Don't be absurd.

1450
01:56:46,501 --> 01:56:49,171
This is the key that was in the necklace

1451
01:56:49,337 --> 01:56:53,008
that unlocks the box
my birth certificate was in.

1452
01:56:56,219 --> 01:56:59,181
Hello, mother.

1453
01:57:04,561 --> 01:57:06,146
It all makes sense now.

1454
01:57:06,605 --> 01:57:07,606
What?

1455
01:57:09,065 --> 01:57:11,318
That you're so extraordinary.

1456
01:57:11,484 --> 01:57:13,945
Of course, you're mine.

1457
01:57:15,197 --> 01:57:18,742
I've longed for someone in my life

1458
01:57:18,909 --> 01:57:21,328
who was as good as me.

1459
01:57:22,913 --> 01:57:25,081
You left me to die.

1460
01:57:26,124 --> 01:57:27,459
A mistake.

1461
01:57:29,085 --> 01:57:31,922
And one we can get past. I know it.

1462
01:57:32,923 --> 01:57:34,257
I disagree.

1463
01:57:34,841 --> 01:57:36,051
Good evening.

1464
01:57:36,426 --> 01:57:38,094
The Baroness asks that you join her

1465
01:57:38,178 --> 01:57:39,262
- on the terrace.
- Lovely.

1466
01:57:39,429 --> 01:57:42,140
Gentlemen, the Baroness would like
to invite you outside, please.

1467
01:57:42,933 --> 01:57:44,684
You're not here for revenge.

1468
01:57:45,227 --> 01:57:47,562
You're here because
you're a brilliant designer

1469
01:57:47,646 --> 01:57:48,939
and a wicked genius

1470
01:57:49,105 --> 01:57:53,443
and you need to be among your own kind.

1471
01:57:54,236 --> 01:57:55,445
Me,

1472
01:57:56,238 --> 01:57:57,906
your real mother,

1473
01:57:59,157 --> 01:58:00,909
who made a mistake

1474
01:58:01,868 --> 01:58:05,997
and let something extraordinary go.

1475
01:58:08,667 --> 01:58:12,504
We are very alike, I suppose.

1476
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:20,762
Good evening,
madam, ravishing as always.

1477
01:58:20,929 --> 01:58:23,890
The Baroness requests
your presence outside.

1478
01:58:29,646 --> 01:58:32,148
I'm sorry.

1479
01:58:36,778 --> 01:58:37,779
You are?

1480
01:58:39,656 --> 01:58:40,865
I am.

1481
01:58:46,538 --> 01:58:48,248
Can I hug you?

1482
01:58:52,877 --> 01:58:54,045
Yes.

1483
01:59:11,271 --> 01:59:13,940
You're not going to push me
off the cliff, are you?

1484
01:59:14,524 --> 01:59:16,985
You're so funny, dear.

1485
01:59:17,986 --> 01:59:19,612
So funny.

1486
01:59:21,031 --> 01:59:22,032
I love it.

1487
01:59:36,504 --> 01:59:37,505
Idiot.

1488
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:49,559
She jumped.

1489
01:59:50,352 --> 01:59:51,895
Did you see? She jumped.

1490
01:59:56,775 --> 01:59:59,361
She tried to drag me with her.

1491
01:59:59,527 --> 02:00:01,571
She jumped, she jumped, she jumped.

1492
02:00:04,449 --> 02:00:05,992
Why are you looking at me like that?

1493
02:00:06,201 --> 02:00:07,660
Oh.

1494
02:00:09,245 --> 02:00:10,413
She jumped!

1495
02:00:11,456 --> 02:00:15,335
What are you doing with those handcuffs?
She jumped!

1496
02:00:20,048 --> 02:00:22,759
<i>So I told you I died.</i>

1497
02:00:22,926 --> 02:00:25,095
<i>Estella, that is.</i>

1498
02:00:26,304 --> 02:00:28,431
<i>Poor thing.</i>

1499
02:00:28,515 --> 02:00:31,101
<i>She couldn't even get anyone
to come to her own funeral.</i>

1500
02:00:34,771 --> 02:00:37,357
That seemed like an unhappy ending.

1501
02:00:38,733 --> 02:00:40,819
Murdered tragically

1502
02:00:41,694 --> 02:00:43,655
<i>by her very own mother.</i>

1503
02:00:43,822 --> 02:00:44,906
Idiot.

1504
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:46,825
<i>A few things.</i>

1505
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,618
<i>Before she died,</i>

1506
02:00:48,701 --> 02:00:51,121
<i>Estella willed her fortune
to her dear friend...</i>

1507
02:00:51,704 --> 02:00:52,872
<i>Cruella de Vil.</i>

1508
02:01:03,007 --> 02:01:04,884
Can't you idiots see?

1509
02:01:05,051 --> 02:01:08,346
That Estella person, it's a trick.

1510
02:01:08,513 --> 02:01:09,681
She's really Cruella.

1511
02:01:09,848 --> 02:01:11,433
Cruella de Vil.

1512
02:01:12,016 --> 02:01:16,104
It's spelled "Devil,"
but it's pronounced "de Vil."

1513
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:19,732
You wait, I'll get even.

1514
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:22,861
<i>The good thing
about evil people is</i>

1515
02:01:23,027 --> 02:01:27,323
<i>you can always trust them
to do something, well,</i>

1516
02:01:28,032 --> 02:01:29,701
<i>evil.</i>

1517
02:01:30,535 --> 02:01:32,078
<i>Estella would die like
her mother did.</i>

1518
02:01:32,245 --> 02:01:33,830
<i>But not quite.</i>

1519
02:01:39,919 --> 02:01:42,922
<i>A well cut skirt
is a lifesaver, girls.</i>

1520
02:01:44,048 --> 02:01:45,133
<i>Remember that.</i>

1521
02:01:53,933 --> 02:01:57,103
<i>She'd go to prison
for throwing someone off a cliff.</i>

1522
02:01:58,313 --> 02:02:00,106
<i>Wrong someone,
but there's something about</i>

1523
02:02:00,190 --> 02:02:03,109
<i>poetic justice that's just so</i>

1524
02:02:04,736 --> 02:02:06,070
<i>poetic.</i>

1525
02:02:07,739 --> 02:02:09,449
Goodbye, Estella.

1526
02:02:15,955 --> 02:02:18,041
<i>She was with her mother now.</i>

1527
02:02:18,208 --> 02:02:20,126
I'll take it from here.

1528
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:23,129
<i>But Cruella was alive.</i>

1529
02:02:23,296 --> 02:02:25,548
All right, we should put on
some music or something.

1530
02:02:25,715 --> 02:02:27,091
Lighten the mood.

1531
02:02:29,052 --> 02:02:31,429
She's not actually dead, mate. She's...

1532
02:02:36,559 --> 02:02:39,896
How can you not get choked up
at all this?

1533
02:02:42,482 --> 02:02:44,025
Oh, man.

1534
02:02:44,984 --> 02:02:47,904
<i>And I call that
a happy ending.</i>

1535
02:03:51,134 --> 02:03:53,970
Has, er, Genghis put on a bit of weight?

1536
02:04:18,244 --> 02:04:19,621
So, what now?

1537
02:04:25,543 --> 02:04:27,629
I've got a few ideas.

1538
02:04:37,055 --> 02:04:41,309
<i>Cruella de Vil
Cruella de Vil</i>

1539
02:04:41,684 --> 02:04:43,895
<i>She's born to be bad</i>

1540
02:04:43,978 --> 02:04:46,481
<i>So run for the hills</i>

1541
02:04:46,564 --> 02:04:51,152
<i>Cruella de Vil
Cruella de Vil</i>

1542
02:04:51,277 --> 02:04:53,529
<i>The fear on your face</i>

1543
02:04:53,655 --> 02:04:56,240
<i>It gives me a thrill</i>

1544
02:04:56,741 --> 02:04:58,785
<i>Who wants to be nice?</i>

1545
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:01,079
<i>Who wants to be tame?</i>

1546
02:05:01,162 --> 02:05:03,039
<i>All of you good guys</i>

1547
02:05:03,122 --> 02:05:05,291
<i>Y'all seem the same</i>

1548
02:05:05,667 --> 02:05:08,002
<i>Original, criminal</i>

1549
02:05:08,503 --> 02:05:10,254
<i>Dressed to kill</i>

1550
02:05:10,338 --> 02:05:13,883
<i>Just call me Cruella de Vil</i>

1551
02:05:15,927 --> 02:05:19,263
<i>Call me crazy, call me insane</i>

1552
02:05:19,347 --> 02:05:21,849
<i>But you're stuck in the past</i>

1553
02:05:21,933 --> 02:05:24,227
<i>And I'm ahead of the game</i>

1554
02:05:25,228 --> 02:05:27,438
<i>A life lived in penance</i>

1555
02:05:27,522 --> 02:05:29,774
<i>It just seems a waste</i>

1556
02:05:29,857 --> 02:05:33,528
<i>And the devil has much better taste</i>

1557
02:05:34,028 --> 02:05:36,364
<i>And I tried to be sweet</i>

1558
02:05:36,447 --> 02:05:38,199
<i>I tried to be kind</i>

1559
02:05:38,282 --> 02:05:41,411
<i>But I feel much better now that I'm</i>

1560
02:05:41,494 --> 02:05:48,167
<i>Out of my mind</i>

1561
02:05:52,714 --> 02:05:55,216
<i>Oh, there always line
at the gates of hell</i>

1562
02:05:55,299 --> 02:05:58,052
<i>But I go right to the front
'cause I dress this well</i>

1563
02:05:58,136 --> 02:06:00,555
<i>Rip it up,
leave it all in tatters</i>

1564
02:06:00,638 --> 02:06:03,433
<i>Beauty is the only thing that matters</i>

1565
02:06:04,851 --> 02:06:10,481
<i>The fabric of your little world is torn</i>

1566
02:06:11,649 --> 02:06:14,527
<i>Embrace the darkness</i>

1567
02:06:14,652 --> 02:06:18,281
<i>Be really blind</i>

1568
02:06:19,282 --> 02:06:21,659
<i>Cruella de Vil</i>

1569
02:06:21,743 --> 02:06:24,078

<i>It gives me a thrill</i>

1571
02:06:47,268 --> 02:06:48,853
Hello, Pongo.
